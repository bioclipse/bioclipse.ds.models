<h1>Lipinski's Rule of Five</h1>

<p><h2>Description</h2>

Lipinski's Rule of Five is a rule of thumb to evaluate druglikeness, or 
determine if a chemical compound with a certain pharmacological  or 
biological activity has properties that would make it a likely orally active 
drug in humans. The rule was formulated by Christopher A. Lipinski in 1997, 
based on the observation that most medication drugs are relatively small and 
lipophilic  molecules.

<p>
Lipinski's rule says that, in general, an orally active drug has no more than one violation of the following criteria:

<ul>
<li>Not more than 5 hydrogen bond donors (nitrogen or oxygen atoms with one or more hydrogen atoms)
<li>Not more than 10 hydrogen bond acceptors (nitrogen or oxygen atoms)
<li>A molecular weight under 500 daltons
<li>An octanol-water partition coefficient log P of less than 5
</ul>

Note that all numbers are multiples of five, which is the origin of the rule's name.    

<p><h2>Result values</h2>
<ul>
<li><i>RuleOfFive Failures</i> - number of failures among Lipinski's five rules</i>
</ul>

<p><h2>Implementation</h2>
The Chemistry Development Kit (version 1.3.4)
