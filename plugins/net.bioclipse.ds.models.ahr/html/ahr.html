<h1>AhR Endpoint</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor 
involved in the biological response to aromatic hydrocarbons, and regulates the 
expression of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450, aldehyde 
dehydrogenase, quinone reductase, and other phase I and phase II detoxification genes.


<h2>Data source</h2>
Data originates from the <a href="http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assay/assay.cgi?aid=2796&loc=ea_ras">PubChem BioAssay 2796</a>, 
named <i>Luminescence-based cell-based high throughput confirmation assay for activators of the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor</i>. 
The data was filtered for unknown CDK atom types, 
and contained after this filtering 15951 compounds where 
7971 were annotated as <i>Active</i>, and 7980 compounds as <i>Inactive</i>.
