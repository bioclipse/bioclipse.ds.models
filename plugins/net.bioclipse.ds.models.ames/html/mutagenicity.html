<h1>Mutagenicity Endpoint</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
Mutagenicity is the ability of a substance to induce mutations to DNA.
<p>
In genetics, a mutagen (Latin, literally origin of change) is a physical or 
chemical agent that changes the genetic material, usually DNA, of 
an organism and thus increases the frequency of mutations above the natural 
background level. As many mutations cause cancer, mutagens are therefore also 
likely to be carcinogens. Not all mutations are caused by mutagens: so-called 
"spontaneous mutations" occur due to spontaneous hydrolysis, errors in DNA replication, 
repair and recombination.
