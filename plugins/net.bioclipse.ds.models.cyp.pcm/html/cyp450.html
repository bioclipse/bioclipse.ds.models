<h1>Carcinogenicity Endpoint</h1>
A carcinogen is any substance, radionuclide, or radiation that is an agent directly 
involved in causing cancer. This may be due to the ability to damage the genome or 
to the disruption of cellular metabolic processes. Several radioactive substances 
are considered carcinogens, but their carcinogenic activity is attributed to the 
radiation, for example gamma rays and alpha particles, which they emit. 
Common examples of non-radioactive carcinogens are inhaled asbestos, 
certain dioxins, and tobacco smoke.
