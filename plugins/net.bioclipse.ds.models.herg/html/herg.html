<h1>hERG</h1>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herg">Human Ether-a-go-go-Related Gene (hERG)</a> encodes the the alpha subunit of a potassium ion channel, 
best known for its contribution to the electrical activity of the heart that coordinates the heart's beating. 
If inhibited or compromised, such as by a drug, it can result in a potentially fatal disorder called long QT syndrome. 
hERG inhibition is hence an important antitarget that must be avoided during drug development.
